<h3> Getting Internet </h3>
                I recently took a flight on Condor from Vancouver to Frankfurt. 
                The plane was a newer A320neo with all the bells and whistles.
                One service being offered was in-flight WiFi which I had never used before!
                Excited to try it, I connected to the local network on the plane, then navigated to the Condor website to purchase access.
                Unfortunately, it looked like the site was broken and the page could not be reached:
                <img src="../resources/airplane_api/cant_be_reached.png"/>

                I was curious to see if I could still access the internet, so I opened up the terminal and ran a traceroute to google.com:
                <img src="../resources/airplane_api/traceroute.png"/>

                The first hop was the local network on the plane, which corresponds to the IP address of the router. 
                Out of curiosity, I pasted the address into my browser to see what would happen. 
                It redericted me to a page where I could buy internet!

                <img src="../resources/airplane_api/condor_website.png"/>

                I must have been the only person on the entire plane who was able to access the internet, because everyone else would have been using the broken URL.
                The speed was pretty good! Especially when considering that we were in a metal tube hurtling through the air at almost 1000 km/h.

                Naturally, I started poking around. The website was making lots of network requests:

                <h3> Digging Around </h3>
<img src="../resources/airplane_api/digging_around.png"/>

                One thing that was quite interesting was this `info.json` endpoint which seemed to contain lots of data like our current position, altitude, destination, and even whether the internet had been disabled by the flight crew or not:
                
                <img src="../resources/airplane_api/info_json.png"/>

                I wrote a quick Python script to keep hitting this endpoint every second and save the data. I was able to track our altitude over time and graphed it:
                
                <h2> Graphing Altitude </h2>
<img src="../resources/airplane_api/altitude.png"/>

                The altitude was surprisingly stable (note that the y-axis markers are only 10 meters)! I wanted to graph speed aswell, but the API only provided our current position in a (latitude, longitude) pair.
                
                <h2> Determining Speed from Positions </h2>
                
                To calculate the speed, I would need to calculate the distance between two points and divide by the time difference. I was able to do this using the Haversine formula:

                <pre><code class="python">
from math import radians, sin, cos, sqrt, atan2

EARTH_RADIUS_KM = 6371

# Compute distance between two points 
def haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    # Convert decimal degrees to radians
    dlat = radians(lat2 - lat1)
    dlon = radians(lon2 - lon1)
    lat1_rad = radians(lat1)
    lat2_rad = radians(lat2)

    # Haversine formula
    a = sin(dlat/2)**2 + cos(lat1_rad) * cos(lat2_rad) * sin(dlon/2)**2
    c = 2 * atan2(sqrt(a), sqrt(1 - a))
    distance = EARTH_RADIUS_KM * c  

    return distance
                </code></pre>

                Which yielded a speed graph that looked something like this:
                
                <img src="../resources/airplane_api/raw_speed.png"/>

                Yikes! Very noisy. To smooth it out, I increased the polling time from 1s to 3s to allow more of a distance to build up between points. Then I smoothed out the signal to get the final speed:

                <img src="../resources/airplane_api/smoothed_speed.png"/>

                Much better! I was able to see that the plane was cruising at around 900 km/h, which the inflight display confirmed.

                <h2> Determining Orientation from Positions </h2>
                To calculate our bearing, I used the following code:

                <pre><code class="python">
# Function to calculate bearing between two points
def calculate_bearing(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    """
    Calculate the bearing between two points on the Earth specified by latitude and longitude.
    """
    lat1_rad = radians(lat1)
    lat2_rad = radians(lat2)
    diff_long = radians(lon2 - lon1)

    x = sin(diff_long) * cos(lat2_rad)
    y = cos(lat1_rad) * sin(lat2_rad) - (sin(lat1_rad) * cos(lat2_rad) * cos(diff_long))

    initial_bearing = atan2(x, y)

    # Convert from radians to degrees and normalize the bearing to 0 - 360 degrees
    initial_bearing = (initial_bearing * 180 / math.pi) % 360

    return initial_bearing
                </code></pre>
                
                And got something that looks like this: 
                <img src="../resources/airplane_api/orientation.png"/>
